## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome!

See [`contributing.md`](https://github.com/3kh0/3kh0.github.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for ways to get started.

Please adhere to this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/3kh0/3kh0.github.io/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

If you would like to help add games, you can do that here: [3kh0/3kh0-Assets](https://github.com/3kh0/3kh0-Assets), this repo only has the UI and other things

Since this project does not require a backend, for the best experience I suggest using [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/), cloning the repo into the Apache Server directory at `C:\xampp\htdocs` (for windows) or `/opt/lampp/htdocs` (for linux), setting the port to something like 8080, opening up a browser and going to [`localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080)

You could also use something like [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server). You will need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) installed also.

Running (npx)
```bash
npx http-server
```

Running (installing to global node_modules)
```bash
# Install
npm install -g http-server

# Running
http-server
```

> **Warning**
> Cloning a repository with Git removes everything in the folder you do it in. If you're not careful, you can delete your hard drive, so please do not do this unless you know what you're doing.
