      <p>Hi! It's Dread. I know this is Ghost's blog, but I'm making a little post about version 2 of the site.</p>
      <p>
        The website you are on now is v2! I started this version with the vision of a clean, easy to use, and sexy looking new version of MNv2. This site has many new features, like JSON loading for games, new themes, and fun animations and
        easter eggs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fun Facts:<br />
        1. Development was started on Jan 3, 2023, just after the new year :D<br />
        2. Version 2 was made with help from Echo and his coders.<br />
        3. The default and Orchid themes are from the two buttons on the homepage of v4 from 3kh0.<br />
        4. Have you heard about the Konami Code?
      </p>
      <p>So play the games, add a review or look around for easter eggs, and enjoy your stay.</p>
      <p>Hopefully v3 will be even better, whenever that happens, but I hope you enjoy this amazing site as much as I do!</p>
      <p>- Dread</p>
